# ansible-playbook action - simple Ansible playbooks for GitHub Actions

`ansible-action` speeds up and simplifies using `ansible-playbook` inside your
GitHub Action workflows by downloading a pre-built docker image for speedy
builds. This has the benefit of being faster that manually installing
`ansible` and its dependencies on every workflow run.

## Usage

Using this workflow is as simple as:

```yaml
jobs:
  some_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: amplium/ansible-action@master
        with:
          playbook: path/to/playbook.yaml
          inventory: path/to/inventory.yaml
          requirements: |
            path/to/requirements.yaml
            other/path/to/requirements.yaml
          extra_vars: |
            some_var=some_value
            some_secret=${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}
```
